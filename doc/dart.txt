DART						*dart.vim* *ft-dart-syntax*

Dart is an object-oriented, typed, class defined, garbage collected language
used for developing mobile, desktop, web, and back-end applications.  Dart uses
a C-like syntax derived from C, Java, and JavaScript, with features adopted
from Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, and others.

More information about the language and its development environment at the
official Dart language website at https://dart.dev

dart.vim syntax detects and highlights Dart statements, reserved words,
type declarations, storage classes, conditionals, loops, interpolated values,
and comments.  There is no support for idioms from Flutter or any other Dart
framework.
